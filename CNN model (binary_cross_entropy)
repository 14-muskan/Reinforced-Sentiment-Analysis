<h1 align="center"> <strong> CNN model based on Binary Cross Entropy Loss </strong> </h1>

This model follows a simple single convolutional layers architecture and uses Glove twitter 25 embeddings from gensim api to understand the semantics of the input sequence.
The input text goes through preprocessing methods - Lemmatization, Stop Word Removal , Tokenization and Padding. 

The model architecture is shown below:
